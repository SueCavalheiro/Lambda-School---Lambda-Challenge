Welcome to the Lambda Challenge! All students must pass this challenge in order to be considered for enrollment at Lambda School. 

There are 4 problems covering the basics of what we have learned in the Mini Bootcamp. You goal is to make all of the tests pass. Follow the instructions for each problem and write the function correctly. Spelling and case DO matter, so make sure your spelling and cases are correct.
